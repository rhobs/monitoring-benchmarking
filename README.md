# monitoring-benchmarking

Performance tests for monitoring stack.  
See [design docs](./docs/design.md) for an overview of the design and the structure of this repo.

## Prerequisites

Fulfill the following prerequisites before using the scripts.

### Get IAM user in our dev account, and setup AWS CLI profile

FIXME: Acccount name TBC

Install the AWS CLI following [its documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).  
Creare an AWS CLI profile called `openshift-monitoring-benchmarks` by running `aws configure --profile=openshift-monitoring-benchmarks` and introducing the credentials you obtained when setting up your IAM user. If all went well you should be able to run the following command successfully.  

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=openshift-monitoring-benchmarks
aws iam get-user 
```

### Install the openshift installer

Download the OpenShift installer CLI and your pull secret from [here](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/aws/installer-provisioned). Add OpenShift installer CLI to your `PATH`, in MacOSX you can do that by adding `export PATH=${PATH}:PATH_TO_openshift-install` to `~/.bash_profile`. Verify by checking the following command runs succesfully.

```bash
openshift-install --help
```

### Install rysnc

MacOS: `brew install rsync`

### Install jq

MacOS: `brew install jq`

## Create and delete cluster

Create a cluster as follows:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=openshift-monitoring-benchmarks
# Define env vars to locate your pull secret, and a public ssh key file to access the cluster nodes.
## path to file where you stored your pull secret
export PULL_SECRET_PATH=...
## path to ssh public key to use to setup ssh access to cluster nodes
export SSH_KEY_PATH=...

# Cluster must include your RH SSO login, this target ensures that
export cluster_name=$(make cluster/new-name)
# adjust accordingly
export num_workers=3
# see available releases at https://quay.io/repository/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release?tab=tags, suffix '-x86_64'
# is automatically added
export ocp_release='4.11.7'
# Check stdout for cluster login (will be removed from log)
make cluster/create
# get cluster credentials
export KUBECONFIG=$(make cluster/kubeconfig)
```

Delete a cluster as follows:

```bash
# If needed see latest cluster name as follows
make cluster/list
# cluster to delete
export cluster_name=...
make cluster/delete
```

## Launch benchmarks on a single cluster

Login in quay and build the benchmarks image:

```bash
docker login -u "${USER}" quay.io
# follow the instructions to make the repo public
make image/push
```

Define a benchmark configuration jsonnet file with the following fields:

```bash
$ cat .local/benchmark_config.jsonnet && echo
{
    pods_per_node: 10,
    pod_churning_period: "1m",
    number_of_ns: 2
}
```

Launch the benchmark on a cluster:

```bash
# Specify cluster to use, list all clusters launched from this host with `make cluster/list`
export cluster_name=...
export KUBECONFIG=$(make cluster/kubeconfig)
make benchmarks/deploy benchmark_config=.local/benchmark_config.jsonnet

# Download results to local disk
make benchmarks/data/download output=$(pwd)/.local

# Uninstall benchmarks: NOTE, this deletes the PVC, so the benchmark data
# is lost in the cluster
make benchmarks/undeploy benchmark_config=.local/benchmark_config.jsonnet
```

## Development 

You can run a shell in the image locally for debugging:

```bash
make image/build/local
make image/shell/local
```

Run benchmarks locally:

```bash
export cluster_name=...
export KUBECONFIG=$(make cluster/kubeconfig)
make run/benchmarks run_root=".local/run_benchmarks/$(date +%Y-%m-%d--%H-%M-%S)" PODS_PER_NODE=10 POD_CHURNING_PERIOD='1m' NUMBER_OF_NS=2
```
